# Typical Bastion
This script helps to configure a typical AWS bastion host and install all basic software. It can be used in the user data section of an EC2 instance.

If you run it locally, don't forget to run "aws config" first or assign a proper IAM role for your new AWS bastion host.

Tested and used on CentOS 7.
